    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pasta Aglio e Olio is easy to make, delicious to eat and the sexiest pasta recipe I know. In about 20 minutes
             you'll be serving glistening pasta loaded with olive oil,
             toasty garlic, fresh parsley, zesty lemon juice and a kick of crushed red pepper.

            Has a movie ever inspired you to buy a cooking utensil? The movie Chef made me buy a carving fork,
             but not for the traditional use. I watched Jon Favreau use one to twist Pasta Aglio e Olio into a gorgeous spiral,
              and I had to have it.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz spahgetti or linguine</li>
            <li>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic <em>thinly sliced</em></li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta and cook
                 according to package directions, until al dente. (see recipe note) Drain, 
                 reserving 1 or more cups of the cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
                 Add garlic; cook and stir until garlic is tender and very lightly brown
                  (take care not to burn it!). Stir in crushed red pepper. 
                  Add pasta and remove from heat; gently toss to coat, adding pasta water 
                  if you like to reach your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Add parsley and lemon juice and toss again. Season to taste with
                 salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Serve topped with grated Parmesan cheese.
