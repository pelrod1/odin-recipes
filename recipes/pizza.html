    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            From humble beginnings as a single pizza restaurant in 1960, Domino’s has become today’s recognized world leader in
             pizza delivery. At Domino’s we’re all about pizza — and from the day our doors opened, we have dedicated ourselves to making and 
             delivering delicious food with high-quality ingredients. Beyond pioneering the concept of efficiently delivering our made-to-order pizzas, we have been a part of innovations that have
             made a significant impact on the entire food delivery industry.</p>
        <p>
            We’re all about delivery ideas that make it easier and more convenient for our customers. When you think about pizza places that have delivered hot and fresh from the oven to your door, think Domino’s, because we’re constantly updating our menu to include more entrees, sides, and desserts created just for you.</p>
