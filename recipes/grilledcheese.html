    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This <em>gooey</em> but still <strong>crispy</strong> grilled cheese is one for the record books! 
        The sourdough bread gets a nice crunch while still allowing the bread to transfer heat to melt the glorious cheese inside.
        The different cheeses in combination with each other make a new mouthfeel that leaves the tastebuds begging for more.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><em>serves 2</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices of Sourdough Bread</li>
            <li>4 slices of Sharp Cheddar</li>
            <li>4 slices of Munster</li>
            <li>2 slices of American Cheese</li>
            <li>favorate butter(mine is garlic parm butter)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get the pan on the stove at a low/med temp. while getting the 
                ingredients out on the cutting board.</li>
            <li>Put a generous amount of butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is up to temperature, place two slices of bread butter side down in the pan.</li>
            <li>Put 2 slices of Cheddar on each slice of bread,do the same 
                for 2 slices of Munster, and 1 slice of American</li>
            <li>top the 2 pile of cheeses with the remaining slices of bread, butter-side up.
                 Cover pan with a lid if possible, if not, lower the temperature.</li>
            <li>Once the bottom of the sandwhich is getting golden brown, flip it over and press
                 the sandwhich down to the pan. The sourdough is a tough 
                enough bread that it is not going to get crushed and 
                lose it's structure like a slices of brioche would.</li>
            <li>Cook until desired crispyness and where the cheese is gooey</li>
            <li><em>enjoy</em></li>

        </ol>
